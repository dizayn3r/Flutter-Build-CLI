# Flutter Build CLI

**Flutter Build CLI** is a Node.js command-line tool that simplifies the process of building a Flutter APK, renaming it based on your project's package name, package version, environment, and the current date/time.

## Features

- **Automated Build**: Select your desired build mode (debug, release, profile) and environment (dev, uat, prod).
- **Custom APK Naming**: Automatically rename the built APK using the package name, package version, environment, and timestamp.
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly, interactive prompts guide you through the build and upload process.

## Prerequisites

Before using this CLI, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **Flutter SDK** (v2.x or later)

3. Install the dependencies:
